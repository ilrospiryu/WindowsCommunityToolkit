Unfortunately, there is no official or fan-made English patch for Ijiwaru My Master. According to some Reddit posts[^1^] [^2^], the only available patch is in Spanish, and it is hard to find the game itself online. Some fans have expressed their interest and frustration in playing this game, but it seems that no one has taken up the project of translating it into English.
 
There are some videos on YouTube that show some gameplay and scenes from Ijiwaru My Master, but they are mostly in Japanese or Spanish. There is also a SoundCloud link[^3^] that claims to have an English patch, but it is likely a scam or a virus. Therefore, it is not recommended to click on it or download anything from it.
 
If you are interested in playing Ijiwaru My Master, you will need to either learn Japanese or Spanish, or hope that someone will eventually make an English patch for it. Until then, you can enjoy some other otome games that are available in English, such as Amnesia, Collar x Malice, Cupid Parasite, Piofiore, and more.

Here are some more paragraphs for the article:
 
Ijiwaru My Master is one of the many otome games that have not been localized or translated into English. Otome games are a subgenre of visual novels that target female audiences and feature romance with male characters. Otome games originated in Japan, but have gained popularity worldwide in recent years. However, not all otome games are accessible to English-speaking fans, due to various reasons such as licensing issues, lack of demand, or difficulty of translation.
 
Some fans have taken matters into their own hands and created fan-made English patches for some otome games. These patches are unofficial and often require hacking or modifying the original game files. Some examples of otome games that have fan-made English patches are Starry Sky, Tokimeki Memorial Girl's Side, and Diabolik Lovers. However, creating a fan-made English patch is not an easy task, and it requires a lot of time, skill, and dedication. Moreover, some fan-made English patches may be incomplete, inaccurate, or buggy.
 
Therefore, fans who want to play Ijiwaru My Master in English will have to wait patiently and hope that someone will eventually make an English patch for it. Alternatively, they can try to learn Japanese or Spanish and play the game in its original language or the existing Spanish patch. Either way, Ijiwaru My Master is a game that has intrigued and frustrated many otome game fans for years, and it remains a mystery for those who cannot understand it.
